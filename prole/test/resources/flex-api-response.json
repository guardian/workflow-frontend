More of that in a moment. Toronto and the US will hope there’s much more from Bradley next year.</p><h2><strong>2) The long goodbye</strong></h2><p>Not so much a moment as a series of them, starting with the most shocking one – Landon Donovan’s surprise omission from the World Cup squad. The manner of it – Donovan was called into the provisional squad, then left out – had the feel of a calculated insult given that the player was nothing if not a known quantity for Klinsmann (and the coach’s son’s Twitter habits didn’t help). As Donovan’s presence, or rather absence, continued to be a storyline through the World Cup and beyond, it was hard to shake the sense that Klinsmann’s polarizing of public opinion over the player had left him vulnerable as he started the next phase of the team’s development<gu-note title=\"Chris Taylor 20/12/2014 at 13:40\" data-note-edited-by=\"Chris Taylor\" data-note-edited-date=\"2014-12-20T18:40:23.163Z\" data-note-id=\"f9b02736-366e-4e2b-bcd6-b66daa3700f8\" class=\"note note--start note--end\"> of the team</gu-note>. That next stage, with its emphasis on <gu-note title=\"Chris Taylor 20/12/2014 at 13:40\" data-note-edited-by=\"Chris Taylor\" data-note-edited-date=\"2014-12-20T18:40:40.801Z\" data-note-id=\"c9376a8f-863c-42cf-a07b-9224b62b5a77\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">the type of </gu-note>deeper structural development for the overall US soccer system, is the sort of work that tends to encounter local resistance. And as US Soccer appeared to circumvent Klinsmann to give Donovan a farewell game against Ecuador in the fall, the coach looked oddly vulnerable at a time he needed his mandate to be at its strongest. The awkward embrace between coach and player at the end of the game said it all. Donovan has gone, for now, but he may haunt Klinsmann for a while to come.</p><h2><strong>3) Fabian Johnson’s goal against Turkey</strong></h2><p>There<gu-note title=\"Chris Taylor 20/12/2014 at 13:19\" data-note-edited-by=\"Chris Taylor\" data-note-edited-date=\"2014-12-20T18:19:08.395Z\" data-note-id=\"545feecf-dceb-4a2a-d394-f828ba0be856\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">’</gu-note> had been signs in the 2-2 draw with Mexico two months earlier (that had seen a switch to the 4-2-3-1 that would lead the side into the World Cup) that Klinsmann’s team was coming together, though there<gu-note title=\"Chris Taylor 20/12/2014 at 13:20\" data-note-edited-by=\"Chris Taylor\" data-note-edited-date=\"2014-12-20T18:20:02.517Z\" data-note-id=\"98942efc-8433-4db3-fe84-ab3f94850dc5\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">’</gu-note> had also been signs of the team’s propensity to let winning positions slip. </p><p>But when Fabian Johnson raced on to Michael Bradley’s deft chip over the top of the Turkey defense<gu-note title=\"Chris Taylor 20/12/2014 at 13:42\" data-note-edited-by=\"Chris Taylor\" data-note-edited-date=\"2014-12-20T18:42:18.388Z\" data-note-id=\"7fdfa708-41d4-490c-d90f-2167c4fb7abd\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">,</gu-note> to fire a perfect first-time shot into the net at Red Bull Arena<gu-note title=\"Chris Taylor 20/12/2014 at 13:42\" data-note-edited-by=\"Chris Taylor\" data-note-edited-date=\"2014-12-20T18:42:23.189Z\" data-note-id=\"8a6805db-0b49-4dc6-bcb3-90469cd47484\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">,</gu-note> in the penultimate warm-up game, it looked like the USA might just be peaking at the right time. Johnson’s pace and ability to attack from the full-back position was emblematic of Klinsmann’s desire for his team to defend compactly and spring forward at speed, and at that moment the US machine looked to be running in perfect order, albeit in demo mode. Now if only Altidore could score ...</p><h2><strong>4) Altidore breaks through, then breaks down</strong></h2><p>It wasn’t the most elegant of finishes, but it was perfectly timed. A few days after the Turkey game, the US played its final warm-up game in the humidity of Jacksonville, Florida. And Jozy Altidore, back in his home state, scored his first goal in six international matches, off yet another surging run and pass from Johnson. When he added a second on yet another great US counter – and with the type of finish Sunderland fans may be inclined to believe lives only in the realm of fiction – it looked like the last piece of the jigsaw had fallen into place at exactly the right moment. </p><p>Ghana, the hamstring and the lack of a striking Plan B all lay ahead, but at that moment it looked like the US were sure to break their run of two World Cups without their strikers scoring a goal.<br></p>"

At a hastily arranged press conference, Don Garber demanded Klinsmann stop commenting on MLS, the US Soccer-sanctioned division one league; chided him for his treatment of Donovan; and suggested that Klinsmann’s comments were contrary to the spirit of common enterprise that existed between US Soccer and MLS. Klinsmann, for his part, was unrepentant, also making comments about the MLS schedule and its incompatibility with Fifa dates and the European calendar. </p><p>The furor crystallized what was always likely to be a problem – the head coach and technical director of US Soccer being the same person (Klinsmann). Klinsmann’s comments about his players may have been valid from a head coach, but in Garber’s view, commenting <gu-note title=\"Chris Taylor 20/12/2014 at 13:52\" data-note-edited-by=\"Chris Taylor\" data-note-edited-date=\"2014-12-20T18:52:55.031Z\" data-note-id=\"1b11c306-90ac-4f58-fc7a-d883b9d36a00\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">in any negative manner</gu-note>negatively about the league and the developmental environment it offers to young players in particular<gu-note title=\"Chris Taylor 20/12/2014 at 13:34\" data-note-edited-by=\"Chris Taylor\" data-note-edited-date=\"2014-12-20T18:34:51.635Z\" data-note-id=\"c56067b6-d49a-492e-9edd-2a143079e970\" class=\"note note--start note--end\">,</gu-note> makes the technical director a very legitimate target for complaint.

Klinsmann’s men ended the year with a few new players coming through, but also a contingent of exhausted-looking MLS players, many of whom had dipped in the wake of the World Cup. The game also seemed to mark a general loss of momentum that wasn’t helped by the perception of Klinsmann’s multiple roles.</p><p>Which battles he chooses to fight, and when, in 2015, will set the tone just as much as another round of challenging friendlies.</p>"
